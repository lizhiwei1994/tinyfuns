## :bar_chart: Overview

We sometimes need to do some processing and transformation of data during data analysis, which is not very difficult, but it takes a few lines of code to do the job. `tidyfuns` is like a **Swiss army knife**, although it is not big, but it is full-featured and can help you finish data processing more efficiently.

## :arrow_double_down: Installation

You can install the development version of **tinyfuns** from Github with:
```{r eval=FALSE}
