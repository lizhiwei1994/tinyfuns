## :bar_chart: Overview

We sometimes need to do some processing and transformation of data
during data analysis, which is not very difficult, but it takes a few
lines of code to do the job. `tidyfuns` is like a **Swiss army knife**,
although it is not big, but it is full-featured and can help you finish
data processing more efficiently.

## :arrow_double_down: Installation

You can install the development version of **tinyfuns** from Github
with:

``` r
devtools::install_github('lizhiwei1994/tinyfuns')
